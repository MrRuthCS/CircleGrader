# CircleGrader
This mobile app was created to use as a tool for people to use to 'grade' their hand drawn circles. We have a circle drawing contest at our high school each year on Pi Day and teachers consistently commented regarding the inconvenience of using a meter stick to measure four 'diameters' of the students hand drawn circles on the whiteboard, recording the measures, and calculating the average deviation from the mean. So I wrote a mobile app to take a picture of a hand drawn circle and make the calculations from the image data.
I created this app using Flutter and Dart as an exercise to see how functional it is to write a single codebase and publish to both iOS and Android. I hope you enjoy the app!

NOTE: I have only posted the essential files for the Android Studio app so you can experient with your own Android Studio project and environment.
